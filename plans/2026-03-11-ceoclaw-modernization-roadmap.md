# CEOClaw Modernization Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Status:** Active
**Depends on:** `plans/2026-03-11-ceoclaw-master-execution-plan.md`

**Canonical source of current execution truth:** `plans/2026-03-11-ceoclaw-master-execution-plan.md`

This roadmap explains the modernization direction and 30/60/90-day shape. It is not a second live checklist.

## 1. Why This Roadmap Exists

CEOClaw has already crossed the alpha threshold for an AI operating layer. Sessions 01 through 42 are complete on the lead branch, and Wave 11 is now complete on top of that baseline. The product already spans:
- enterprise fact intake;
- evidence and verification;
- proposal and apply;
- outbound delivery;
- operator control;
- knowledge and enterprise truth rollups.

The current 90-day modernization run has delivered its core target on the lead branch.

That delivered target is:

`durable execution -> deeper source truth -> pilot-grade operator control`

## 2. Modernization Thesis

CEOClaw should evolve from a strong alpha into a pilot-grade, evidence-backed operating system for project-driven organizations.

The highest-leverage gaps are now:

1. the governance loop now exists end to end, so the next wave should be chosen from observed operator friction rather than assumed upfront;
2. tenant widening now has a bounded rollout packet and handoff export, so the next gap should be validated from real usage rather than solved with a speculative workflow engine;
3. GPS, 1C, reconciliation, and operator depth should be prioritized only after Wave 11 artifacts show where the next trustworthy bottleneck actually sits;
4. the next wave should stay narrow and evidence-backed rather than reopening broad platform expansion.

## 3. Current Baseline

As of 2026-03-11 the lead branch already has:

1. import and validation pipeline;
2. generalized AI proposal/apply engine;
3. executive brief and alert engine;
4. work report workflow;
5. workspace, membership, and policy model;
6. plan-vs-fact and financial truth layer;
7. meeting-to-action and work-report-to-action vertical slices;
8. live Telegram and SMTP outbound channels;
9. live GPS/GLONASS and 1C read paths;
10. evidence ledger with `reported / observed / verified` states;
11. Video Fact MVP and cross-source confidence fusion;
12. AI trace, provenance, eval coverage, and action safety/compensation;
13. escalation queue, knowledge loop, enterprise truth rollup, normalized GPS telemetry truth, normalized 1C financial truth with deterministic project deltas, persisted reconciliation casefiles for inspectable mismatch reasons, an executive command center with a shared exception inbox across escalations and reconciliation gaps, deterministic audit packs for workflow evidence, trace, and decision handoff, explicit pilot controls with tenant/workspace rollout posture, a persisted pilot feedback ledger linked to real workflow artifacts, a tenant readiness checklist with explicit cutover blockers, and pilot review scorecards with deterministic governance export.

## 4. Gaps Still Open

The following high-value gaps remain open:

1. Pilot review still needs one recurring delivery/scheduling path instead of manual artifact pickup.
2. Tenant readiness and pilot review still need a durable approval/waiver trail for real cutover decisions.
3. The next tenant rollout still needs a repeatable onboarding/runbook boundary.
4. GPS, 1C, and reconciliation depth should be prioritized only after this governance loop produces evidence about the next bottleneck.

## 5. 30-Day Plan

### Wave 7: Durable Runtime Hardening

#### Session 27: AI Run Persistence and Workflow Ledger

Goal:
- move AI runs, packet state, apply state, and trace metadata from file cache into durable database truth.

Deliver:
- Prisma-backed workflow ledger for runs and traces;
- migration-safe server-run persistence layer;
- compatibility path for existing operator trace views.

Exit criteria:
- process restarts do not lose canonical run state;
- `.ceoclaw-cache` stops being the source of truth for live workflows;
- at least one existing operator workflow reads its run state from durable storage.

Status:
- complete on 2026-03-11 in the lead branch.

#### Session 28: Evidence and Escalation Sync Jobs

Goal:
- remove critical sync-on-read behavior from evidence and escalation derivation.

Deliver:
- explicit sync jobs or outbox-driven derivation for evidence and escalation layers;
- idempotent job boundaries;
- operator-visible sync freshness instead of hidden background work during reads.

Exit criteria:
- `/api/evidence` and `/api/escalations` no longer need to create truth as part of every read;
- derivation failures can be diagnosed without replaying page loads;
- freshness and lag are visible.

Status:
- complete on 2026-03-11 in the lead branch.

#### Session 29: Delivery Ledger and Idempotent Execution

Goal:
- make outbound delivery auditable, retry-safe, and deterministic across Telegram, email, and scheduled sends.

Deliver:
- delivery job ledger;
- idempotency keys and retry posture;
- operator-visible execution history for outbound actions.

Exit criteria:
- repeated sends are controllable and explainable;
- delivery retries stop depending on blind re-execution;
- outbound actions become auditable per run and per target.

Status:
- complete on 2026-03-11 in the lead branch.

## 6. 60-Day Plan

#### Session 31: 1C Financial Truth Deepening

Goal:
- deepen 1C from one finance sample into a more useful project truth source.

Deliver:
- broader project finance slices suitable for reconciliation;

- create a durable, inspectable reconciliation casefile that links finance, telemetry, work reports, and video evidence.

Deliver:
- casefile model or equivalent linked read layer;
- explainable matching and mismatch reasons;
- one operator surface for unresolved reconciliation gaps.

Status:
- complete on 2026-03-12 in the lead branch.

Exit criteria across Wave 8:

1. GPS and 1C truth become materially deeper than narrow sample reads.
2. Cross-source mismatches are inspectable as cases, not only summary counters.
3. Operators can answer why a project is corroborated, partial, or contradictory.

## 10. Research Principles Behind This Roadmap

This roadmap follows the most consistent guidance from current agent-system practice:

1. Prefer bounded workflows over premature autonomy.

## 9. Success Metrics

This modernization is working if:

1. canonical workflow state survives restarts and partial failures;
2. evidence and escalation freshness are visible without deriving truth during every read;
3. GPS and 1C become richer truth domains, not just sample proofs;
4. reconciliation gaps become explicit operator workload;
5. outbound actions are auditable and idempotent;
6. one operator command layer can drive pilot follow-through end to end;
7. audit packs exist for pilot review without manual screenshot assembly.

## 10. What We Still Have Not Done

For planning clarity, the following remain explicitly out of scope or unfinished:

1. full autonomous multi-agent runtime;
2. 1C write-back;
3. full GPS sync engine across all telemetry entities;
4. enterprise-wide reconciliation beyond the chosen wedge domains;
5. generalized tenant platform or marketplace abstractions;
6. arbitrary rollback of downstream side effects beyond bounded compensation guidance.
